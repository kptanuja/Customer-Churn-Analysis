# Customer Churn Analysis ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project predicts **customer churn** using data analysis and machine learning.  
It helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to retain them.

## Dataset
The dataset contains telecom customer details such as:
- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Payment method
- Churn status

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ handled missing values, data type conversions.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ visualized churn patterns and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ created new features like `tenure_group`.
4. **Modeling** â€“ tested Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Evaluation** â€“ measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
- Achieved **79.49% accuracy** on churn prediction.
- Key churn factors: Contract type, Tenure, Monthly Charges.
